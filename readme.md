## TeamCity.SpecFlow.Reporting

**TeamCity.Specflow.Reporting** is a low ceremony, convention over configuration, PowerShell module that automates the process of displaying SpecFlow reports.

It also, automatically, handles the error caused by .NET 4 or higher:

> "`The element <ParameterGroup> beneath element <UsingTask> is unrecognized.`"

...discussed [here](https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow/issues/232).

It's distributed via [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/TeamCity.SpecFlow.Reporting) and requires minimal configuration in TeamCity.
